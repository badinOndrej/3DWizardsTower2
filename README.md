# 3DWizardsTower2
A standalone sequel to 3D Wizard's Tower (https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/46805), maybe...

# Requirements
PyGame - pip install pygame

# Current progress
- wall rendering broken
- sprite rendering sort of okay
- automap rendering done (easy...)
- partial implementation of doors (before I managed to break wall rendering)
